### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Kevin! I'm a currently finishing my time at Lambda School for iOS mobile development. I have been creating projects using Swift, Objective-C, and Python. A current interest is learning the Vapor framework to create my first API. When I'm not coding my passions include fitness, playing music, and almost any outdoor activities.
